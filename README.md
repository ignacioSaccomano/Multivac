# Multivac
This repository´s goal is to automatize as many things as possible, starting with a simple arduino program that checks temperature and turns on any device by a relay.

Also, as you may see now or in previous commits it is in spanish. At the moment (3/3/2020 - 5:18 AM) i am working on a new branch similar to master but in english so everyone can access the innovative ideas that i try to make and share in this repository. Feel free to ask anything and optimize or correct any part you like or consider necessary, as i am a beginner and would love to receive feedback.

PD: If you didn´t get it, this repo´s name is based on Asimov´s sci fi large computer. I personally recommend reading his stories (specially his Foundation saga). As you can see, they are really inspiring.

Enjoy ;)
